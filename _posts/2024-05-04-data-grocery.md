This analysis explores trends in a grocery store’s sales data over the past year. We use Python and pandas to clean and summarize data, matplotlib for visualization, and identify key seasonal changes in product performance.

Key findings include:

- Peak sales during November and December due to holidays
- Dairy products consistently perform well on weekends
- Sales decline significantly on rainy weekdays

In future work, we’ll integrate external weather and promotion data for deeper insights.
